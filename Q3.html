     <p class="p1">The slave escapes from her master and hides in the woods-and finds him facing a limbing lion ... 
        The story of Androcles and the lion is said to have been written by Aesop- A great Greek narrator moral animal world story that always summarizes him. For Androcles, the lessons are: "Thanks is a sign of a noble soul!" 
        Recitation by Natasha. Time required 6 minutes 5 seconds 
        Calibration by Claire Deekin. In ancient times, a slave named Androcles fled from his master to the woods and  wandered there for a long time until he was tired. 
        At that moment, he heard the lion moan, moan, and sometimes terribly roar. 
        And when  he was about to wake up in 
       , he saw a lion coming towards him.

     <p class="p2">

        Instead of attacking him, he continued to moan and moan and  saw Androcles. Androcles saw the lion stretching his right leg, which was heavily swollen with blood. Androcles looked at it in more detail and  saw a large thorn stuck on his leg. This was the cause of all Lion's problems. 
        With all his courage, he grabbed the thorn and pulled it from the painful barking lion's leg when the thorn came out, but soon  found  relief enough to rub it against Androcles. He is grateful that he has been freed from such pain. 
        One day, some soldiers marched through the woods and found Androcles.

      <p class="p3">
        They captured him  and brought him back to the city, where he was sentenced to death for fleeing his master. 
        It was now customary to throw murderers and other criminals at lions. 
        And on the  day he was appointed he was taken to the arena. 
        The Roman emperor was in the royal family that day and signaled the lion to go out and attack Androcles. But what do you think it did when it came out of the cage and approached Androcles? Instead of jumping on him, it rubbed him and petted him with his feet.
