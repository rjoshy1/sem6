        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including <a href="">layout</a>, <a href="">colors</a>,
        and <a href="">fonts</a>. This separation can improve content <a href="">accessibility</a>; provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple <a href="">web pages</a> to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
        structural content; and enable the .css file to be <a href="">cached</a> to improve the page load speed between the
        pages that share the file and its formatting.
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speechbased browser or <a href="">screen reader</a>), and on <a href="">Braille-based</a> tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a <a href="">mobile device</a>.
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
        if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
